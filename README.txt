This program was designed to be run on a VirtualBox environment with a Vagrant instance running a PostgreSQL database backend. No testing was implemented on other environments to check compatibility.

To run the program, open the command prompt on the Linux virtual machine. Navigate to the /vagrant/tournament/ directory.
